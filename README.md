## Overview 

I started learning to code in February 2018 after a lot encouragement from my Wife and Sister-in-law. It wasn't until October 2020 that I believe my "why" was greater than anything and since then I have poured countless hours in my pursuit of understanding front-end technologies.

This project represents my first portfolio as a Front-end Developer.

## Approach

Learning HTML + CSS was the first thing I learnt after buying a book by Jon Duckett. Then I bought the JavaScript and that's how it all started.
